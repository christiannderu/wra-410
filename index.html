                I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created a simple website and styled it using CSS in WRA 210. I'm struggling to remember a lot of it though but it's been fun to get back to HTML & CSS.

                In this class, I hope to learn more about web development best practices, responsive design, and advanced JavaScript concepts. My goal is to become proficient in building modern and user-friendly websites with HTML, CSS & Javascript. I'm excited to see if I can apply this to real world projects!
